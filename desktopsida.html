            Ground Control to Major Tom

            Ground Control to Major Tom. Take your protein pills and put your helmet<br>
            on. Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six).<br> 
            Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three). Check ignition<br> 
            and may God's love be with you (two, one, liftoff). This is Ground Control 
            to Major Tom.<br>
            You've really made the grade. And the papers want to know whose shirts<br>
            you wear. Now it's time to leave the capsule if you dare. This is Major Tom<br>
            to Ground Control. I'm stepping through the door.
